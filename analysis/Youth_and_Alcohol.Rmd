**Do drinking age restrictions and legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits for young drivers have any effect on adolescentsâ€™ drinking among countries?**

_Researcher: Kexin Xu_

## Description of Data
All data sets below are downloaded from [**Global Information System on Alcohol and Health (GISAH)**](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.gisah.GISAH?showonly=GISAH) in WHO.  

1. BAC limits
  - The data describes legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits for young/novice drivers.
  - The data contains BAC restrictions in each country in year 2016.

2. Age limits
  - The data shows age limits for both alcohol sales and alcohol service.
  - The data contains age restrictions on selling and serving different types of alcohol in each country in year 2016.
  
3. Current drinkers 15-19
  - The data tells the percentage of current drinkers between 15 and 19 years old.
  - The data is consist of percentage of current young drinkers across gender in each country in year 2016.

4. Heavy drinkers 15-19
  - The data represents the percentage of heavy episodic drinkers among drinkers between 15 and 19 years old.
  - The data is consist of percentage of heavy drinkers among young drinkers across gender in each country in year 2016.
